# EigenvectorGrapher
This is a project that I built for my Linear Algebra Class in Spring of 2018. 
Purpose was to graph the relationship between populations in a predator/prey relationship. Based on starting value for each, the population behavior is graphed according to the eigenvectors.
To run this project use py3.codeskulptor.org, as t includes the neccesary UI frameworks for the graph. Direct link to project can be found here: https://goo.gl/sa1Mvt
